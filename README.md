### Hello World!! ðŸ‘‹
# I'm Zain
----------------------------------------**

A **Software Engineer**, a full stack mobile and web developer, working with Flutter & React/Nextjs to create beautiful mobile & web apps. I have worked on a ton of projects for practice and have built production-ready web apps for clients. I have also worked on flutter apps and have published one on the play store as well.

I believe in the problem-solving approach, to look at my projects and solve their problems, not just in a technical way but in ways that are most efficient and user friendly. I try to utilize promising methods and strategies from software engineering that ensure the apps are developed in the most effective and scalable way possible.

#### NOTE: 
- Top Languages do not indicate my skill level or anything like that, it's a GitHub metric of which languages have the most code on my GitHub.

- Most of my work goes into private repositories, on freelance projects.

- Looking forward to working on some side projects as opensource.
